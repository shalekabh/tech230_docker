kubectl get svc: get service info.

kubectl get deployment <name-deployment> or kubectl get deploy: deployment info, which can be for a specific deployment or all deployments.

kubectl create -f <.yml>: runs .yml file to create K8s cluster (-f = file).

kubectl get pods: get pods info.

kubectl get rs: get replica set info.

kubectl describe deploy <name-deployment>: human-readable logs on deployment.

kubectl describe svc <name-svc>: human-readble logs on service.

kubectl delete deployment <deployment-name>: delete deployment.

K8 Deploy Sparta App Cluster
K8s Cluster Sparta App

Ensure a cluster is running with kubectl get service.
Create app-deployment.yml file and app-service.yml file. app-deployment.yml:
# api used for deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1

    targetPort: 3000
Run deployment with kubectl create -f app-deployment.yml, then run service with kubectl create -f app-service.yml.
Check web browser for http://localhost:\<specified-port-between-30000-32767-in-service.yml>.
K8 Deploy MongoDB and connect to App Cluster
Ensure a cluster is running with kubectl get service.
Create mongo-deployment-and-service.yml file. mongo-deployment-and-service.yml:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mongo-deployment
  labels:
    # label selector
    db: mongo

      # Service port, accessible at this port
      port: 27017
      # same as containerPort of deployment/stateful set
      targetPort: 27017
Run deployment and service kubectl create -f mongo-deployment-and-service.yml then run the app's deployment and service files.
Check web browser for Sparta Provisioning Test App/posts page.
Note: To delete all these services and deployments: kubectl delete deploy sparta-app-deployment mongo-deployment | kubectl delete svc sparta-app-svc mongo-service.
